            <h3 class="post-heading">Soundcloud alternative</h3>
            <time class="post-time">2023-07-02</time>
        </header>
        <p>I looked a little deeper inside myself and found two reasons why I started uploading on Youtube in the first place.</p>
        <p>Initially, ~10 years ago it was because I used several computers and the songs I wanted to listen to were not available online. So Youtube served me like a cloud storage, which I didn’t mind other people would have access to. Well, I would love other people to listen to the same songs that I appreciate, but it wasn’t the main reason.</p>
        <p>It became the main reason when I started to create my own music, and I wanted to have an easy way to share it with the world. The most obvious choice was Soundcloud. However, after a while - about 1 year - I hit their 3 hours limit, and that made me release my tracks on Youtube only. Youtube served me as an alternative to SoundCloud.</p>
        <p>Reddit search for "SoundCloud alternatives" was somewhat promising, indeed there are people with the same two problems - they look for cloud storage for their music to listen to it on many devices, or they want to share the music they wrote with the world.</p>
        <p>I believe it better shapes my target audience than "amateur musicians that don’t want to bother with a record label" which was in my imagination until this moment. I replied to a few of those threads on Reddit, and it didn’t feel like I’m spamming. People are asking for something better than SoundCloud and I’m giving it. </p>
        <p>That was a refreshing thought. I'll try to find more people who are looking for the cloud music storage or look for ways to share their music with audience. Meanwhile, I keep working on a prototype. For it at least to be able to generate timecodes when you select a bunch of mp3's.</p>

        </header>
        <p>The first image is the desktop application, the following are the wireframes I'm going to rely on when building this web-service.</p>
        <div class="image-gallery">
            <div class="image-wrapper">
                <a href="./assets/2023-06/desktop-app.png" target="_blank">
                    <img class="image" src="./assets/2023-06/small/desktop-app.png" />
                </a>
            </div>
            <div class="image-wrapper">
                <a href="./assets/2023-06/home-screen.png" target="_blank">
                    <img class="image" src="./assets/2023-06/small/home-screen.png" />
                </a>
            </div>
            <div class="image-wrapper">
                <a href="./assets/2023-06/song-upload.png" target="_blank">
                    <img class="image" src="./assets/2023-06/small/song-upload.png" />
                </a>
            </div>
            <div class="image-wrapper">
                <a href="./assets/2023-06/album-upload.png" target="_blank">
                    <img class="image" src="./assets/2023-06/small/album-upload.png" />
                </a>
            </div>
        </div>
        <p>The desktop screen is very dense. This time I decided to have a separate very light-weight screen when you want to upload only one song.</p>
        <p>And when you want to upload a whole album there have to be more settings. The descriptions for the song videos and the timecodes in the album video will be automatically generated, therefore I think it'll worth to show the preview.</p>
        <p>In the desktop app I the descriptions could use placeholders like %playlist% that would denote where the automatically generated part will be inserted. However I think I myself always just added the timecodes in the end and name of the artist before the song title, and it always was fine. Therefore now this functionality won't be configured, and I will see what the users will say during interviews.</p>

            <h3 class="post-heading">Hello world!</h3>
            <time class="post-time">2023-06-25</time>
        </header>
        <p>Long story short is that for quite a while I was uploading songs and albums on YouTube, both my own and other people's songs. That was menial work, which seemed to be very easy to automate.</p>
        <p>And indeed it was! Some time ago, I created a desktop application to upload albums on Youtube. You select an image, a list of mp3 files, press the "Conver & Upload" button and voila - after a while there is a long whole-album video with timecodes (chapters) and a playlist of separate videos.</p>
        <p>For instance, this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNn0mxd2rE8">Whole album as a single video</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjlQq2ygfw&list=PLiKe0bLqMuMuFrmjZCDdT13do_oZukFnh&pp=gAQBiAQB">Playlist of individual songs as separate videos.</a>
        </p>
        <p>So, I've been using that application myself for a while already. Recently I've started thinking about how to monetize it. I've done some calculations and it seems there are high chances it'll pay off server rent quite soon. Not sure though if it'll pay for the work I'm going to spend on its development.</p>
        <p>The time will show it. I'm going to use the Lean Startup approach. Briefly, it means "to test your ideas as quickly and as cheaply as possible". Therefore I'm starting with a survey and a series of in-depth user interviews.</p>
        <p>If you want to participate in such an interview, please leave your contacts in the form: <a href="https://forms.gle/L6T1K58FTwF3bUpW9">https://forms.gle/L6T1K58FTwF3bUpW9</a>.
