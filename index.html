        <p>Long story short is that for quite a while I was uploading songs and albums on YouTube, both my own and other people's songs. That was menial work, which seemed to be very easy to automate.</p>
        <p>And indeed it was! Some time ago, I created a desktop application to upload albums on Youtube. You select an image, a list of mp3 files, press the "Conver & Upload" button and voila - after a while there is a long whole-album video with timecodes (chapters) and a playlist of separate videos.</p>
        <p>For instance, this: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BNn0mxd2rE8">Whole album as a single video</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pYjlQq2ygfw&list=PLiKe0bLqMuMuFrmjZCDdT13do_oZukFnh&pp=gAQBiAQB">Playlist of individual songs as separate videos.</a>
        </p>
        <p>So, I've been using that application myself for a while already. Recently I've started thinking about how to monetize it. I've done some calculations and it seems there are high chances it'll pay off server rent quite soon. Not sure though if it'll pay for the work I'm going to spend on its development.</p>
        <p>The time will show it. I'm going to use the Lean Startup approach. Briefly, it means "to test your ideas as quickly and as cheaply as possible". Therefore I'm starting with a survey and a series of in-depth user interviews.</p>
        <p>If you want to participate in such an interview, please leave your contacts in the form: <a href="https://forms.gle/L6T1K58FTwF3bUpW9">https://forms.gle/L6T1K58FTwF3bUpW9</a>.

        <p>Thank you!</p>
